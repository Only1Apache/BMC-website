## Post World Button & Modal
- A "Post World" button now appears between the Worlds page header and the BMC Worlds panel.
- This button is only visible to logged-in Members (enabled) and Admins (disabled with tooltip), hidden for guests.
- Clicking the button opens a modal containing the "Submit a New World" form, cloned from the hidden panel in the DOM.
- The original inline panel remains in the HTML for reference but is hidden via `display:none`.
- CSS ensures the button is responsive (full width on narrow screens).
- Modal submit behavior remains unchanged and handled by `submit-post.js`.

To modify placement or behavior:
- Edit the toolbar markup injected after `<section id="page-worlds">` in `index.html`.
- Adjust the JS at the bottom of the file to change how the modal content is populated.
